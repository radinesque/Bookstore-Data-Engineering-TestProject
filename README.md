Data Engineering test project using MySQL and Python

# Bookstore Data Engineering Test Project

## Overview

This repository contains a test project focused on data engineering tasks related to a fictional bookstore's Point of Sale (POS) system. The project provides SQL queries and a Python script for data extraction and ingestion.

## Project Description

This test project simulates data engineering tasks that might be encountered in a real-world scenario. The dataset provided in "Appendix A" includes three CSV files: `customers.csv`, `invoices.csv`, and `invoice_lines.csv`. These files represent data from a bookstore's POS system.

The project covers the following tasks:

1. **SQL Queries**: SQL queries are provided for data extraction and analysis tasks, such as finding customers who purchased more than five books and identifying customers who never made a purchase.

2. **Python Script**: A Python script is provided to perform data ingestion and extraction tasks using the dataset.

## Prerequisites

To run the Python script and execute the SQL queries, you'll need the following:

- A MySQL database server
- The `mysql-connector-python` Python library (installable via `pip`)
- A basic understanding of SQL and Python

## File Structure

The project's file structure is organized as follows:

- `/SQL`: Contains SQL queries for the data engineering tasks.
- `/Python`: Contains the Python script for data extraction and ingestion.
- `README.md`: This documentation.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.

## Usage

You can use this project to practice data engineering tasks, learn SQL, and work on Python data ingestion and extraction. To get started:

1. Set up a MySQL database and import the dataset from "Appendix A."
2. Review the provided SQL queries in the `/SQL` directory to understand the tasks.
3. Run the Python script in the `/Python` directory to perform data ingestion and extraction tasks.

## SQL Queries

- `question2.sql`: SQL queries for data extraction tasks related to customers and their purchases.
- `question3.sql`: SQL queries for data extraction tasks based on the provided dataset.

## Python Script

- `data_ingestion.py`: A Python script for data extraction and ingestion from the provided dataset.
